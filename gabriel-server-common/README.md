# gabriel-server-common

All Gabriel applications need to use the [gabriel-server](gabriel-server) module. If you want to run the server and the cognitive engine within the same Python program, this you just need this module. 

The [gabriel-standalone-engine](gabriel-standalone-engine) module is required to run the cognitive engine separately from the server.
